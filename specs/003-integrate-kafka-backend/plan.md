# Implementation Plan: Backend Kafka Startup Bootstrap + RAG Test-Event API + WebSocket Channel

**Branch**: `003-integrate-kafka-backend` | **Date**: 2026-06-12 | **Spec**: `specs/003-integrate-kafka-backend/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-integrate-kafka-backend/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Extend the backend service startup lifecycle to create Kafka topics from `project/topics` idempotently, and add a gated test-event API for topic `rag` that publishes a `RAGRequestEvent` payload directly with default schema values applied. The API returns a normalized publish result with inline Kafka metadata when available. Additionally, mount a Socket.IO WebSocket channel on the FastAPI ASGI app so the frontend can connect and receive asynchronous Kafka-driven results routed per session: a minimal `ConnectionManager` maps `session_id` (== Socket.IO `sid`) to its connection, shared event-name constants live in `project/events.py` (including `stream-tokens`), and a dedicated `socket.py` holds lightweight listeners plus an `emit_event(event, payload, session_id)` function. Implementation keeps advanced validation, resilience, and WebSocket edge-case handling as TODO-marked follow-ups while satisfying current observability and performance budgets.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+  
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, Pydantic v2, kafka-python, python-socketio (ASGI), python-dotenv  
**Storage**: N/A (Kafka is external messaging infrastructure, not app-owned storage)  
**Testing**: pytest (unit + integration-like API, startup, and WebSocket connection/emit tests)  
**Target Platform**: Linux backend service runtime (local docker-compose + CI Linux)
**Project Type**: Backend web service (FastAPI + Kafka integration + Socket.IO WebSocket channel)  
**Performance Goals**: Startup topic bootstrap <= 5s in local dev cluster; rag test-event publish response <= 2s p95 in local dev cluster; WebSocket emit dispatch is in-process and non-blocking  
**Constraints**: Synchronous implementation; idempotent topic creation; test-event APIs enabled by default in dev/test, explicit opt-in in production; no direct agent invocation from API; no separate schema model for test-event metadata; single shared producer owned by the Kafka admin layer; WebSocket integration favors minimum boilerplate — connection manager is a simple get/set class, listeners are lightweight stubs, and edge cases (disconnect cleanup, missing session, auth, back-pressure) are deferred via TODO markers; `project/events.py` holds event-name constants only (no payload models)  
**Scale/Scope**: Current registry includes `rag` and `rag-complete`; immediate scope adds one topic-specific test publish route (`rag`) with extensible per-topic routing pattern, plus a Socket.IO channel with one defined event (`stream-tokens`) whose emission logic is stubbed for later implementation

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Code Quality Gate: Pass `ruff check project backend_service` and `ruff format --check project backend_service`; fail the feature if either check fails.
- Testing Gate: Add/maintain tests for startup bootstrap path, route env-gating behavior, request validation against `RAGRequestEvent`, publish response envelope/metadata behavior, and WebSocket connection registration + per-session `emit_event` routing; run `pytest backend_service/tests -q`.
- UX Consistency Gate: API response patterns must remain consistent with existing backend JSON envelope conventions (`status`, typed response body, explicit error message) and deterministic HTTP status usage; WebSocket event names must be sourced from the shared `project/events.py` constants so frontend and backend stay in sync.
- Performance Gate: Verify bootstrap summary timing under local Kafka is <= 5s and rag test-event request/response path stays within <= 2s p95 under local single-request testing; WebSocket emit is an in-process dispatch with no added budget.
- Maintainability Gate: Keep route wiring in `create_app`, schema contracts in `project/schemas.py`, shared event-name constants in `project/events.py`, and add explicit logging at startup/publish boundaries. WebSocket integration stays minimal: a simple `ConnectionManager` with get/set, lightweight listeners in `socket.py`, and deferred edge cases marked with TODO comments.

Post-Design Re-check (Phase 1): PASS
- No constitution violations introduced by selected design.
- All gates have corresponding implementation/test artifacts planned in Phase 2.
- Simplicity principle upheld: WebSocket layer deliberately defers edge-case handling via TODO markers per spec FR-027.

**Structure Decision**: Keep the existing backend service FastAPI structure and add feature behavior by extending `backend_service/app/main.py`, `backend_service/app/api/topics.py`, `backend_service/app/config.py`, and Kafka support modules, with shared contracts in `project/schemas.py` and topic registry in `project/topics.py`. For the WebSocket channel, add `project/events.py` (shared event-name constants), `backend_service/app/connection_manager.py` (simple `ConnectionManager` with get/set keyed by `session_id`), and `backend_service/app/socket.py` (Socket.IO server instance, lightweight listeners, and `emit_event`). The Socket.IO ASGI app is mounted onto the FastAPI app in `main.py`.
